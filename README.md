# What is WEATHR?

WEATHR is a small and concise tool to get forecast for current, hourly and daily weather based on the user's locaiton.

This is a small practice project to hone my skills in using frontend frameworks for app creation and how to call and use public apis. The project also gave a glimpse on the need to plan a project and thought process before starting a project.


This was overall a fun project with a lot of teachings and i look forward to doing much more!
